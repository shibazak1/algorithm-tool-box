#celebration party statte that :
#if you have n children can you groupe this children into minimum number of group
#with constrain that no tow children with age gap more than 2 years


#it turn out that this problem is simuler to point cover by segemnt problem
#what is the minimum number of segemnt of leangth  needed to cover n point
